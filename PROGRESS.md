## Next Steps

1. Revoke or rotate the Shlink API key used during migration
2. Plan optional V4 long-tail enhancements only if needed: bulk UTM automation, target failure alerts, link notes, public stats, OpenGraph previews, or long-idle auto-archive
3. Cut over `s.y8o.de` from Shlink to Linkora when ready
